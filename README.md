# I-Community
Information is necessary for everyone. Inside an institute one must stay updated about all events or it may turn out to be a big problem for them.   Though there is E-mail facilities, but it is seldom used by students and it is not user interactive. This calls for a solution which will be much more user friendly and serve many other purposes for everyone concerned.   At this moment I-Community which is a community and also is basically an informative portal aimed for people associated with an educational institute.  Such as Students, Faculty, Exam-Cell, Placement Department and other concerned departments.  I-Community also focuses on problem solving by resolving problems/issues faced by students in various fields.
